# Changelog

Newest first. Each version lists what changed for an app that uses `@softure-ai/marketing-kit`. When an app has run a version in
production, the version gets a line `verified in: <app>@<commit>` ([docs/05](../../docs/05-adoption-playbook.md),
"Definition of done"). Versions before the first one below are described in their GitHub Releases (`marketing-kit@x.y.z`).

## 0.1.9

- `fill` replaces a value already in the input: the old value is selected and deleted on screen, then the new one is
  typed (over a prefilled `45`, `fill … "50"` records `50`, not `4550`). An empty input records as before; `"clear":
  false` keeps the old behaviour; an input the app refills makes the action fail with its name.
- New `press` action and `Director.press(key, { times, perKey })`: any key (`Backspace`, `Enter`, `ControlOrMeta+A`)
  one or more times. A hand-written `Director` needs the new method.

## 0.1.8

- Described in the GitHub Release `marketing-kit@0.1.8`.
