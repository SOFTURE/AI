# SOFTURE AI: agent rules

## Language: English only in code

Everything that lands in the repository is written in **English**: code, identifiers, comments,
commit messages, script output, log and error messages, file and folder names, configuration keys,
and skill or agent instructions. This holds even when the conversation with the owner is in Polish.

- Do not translate the conversation into the code. A Polish request still produces English code.
- User-facing product copy is the only exception. It lives in message dictionaries (e.g. `messages/en.ts`),
  never inline in code. Polish language data that is not copy (a text ruleset's word lists, Polish test
  articles) lives in a folder named `pl/`, which the language gate also exempts.
- When you touch a file that contains Polish code, comments or identifiers, translate them in the
  same change.
- Before every commit, check the diff for Polish (Polish diacritics and Polish words) outside
  message dictionaries. Treat any hit as a failing gate. `npm run lint:language` does this check
  (the `pre-commit` hook runs it on staged files).

## Gates and hooks

```bash
npm ci                 # installs devDependencies (also under NODE_ENV=production, see .npmrc) and the git hooks
npm run typecheck      # tsc over the whole tree; packages resolve to src/ through the @softure-ai/source condition
npm run lint           # ESLint (typed rules, zero warnings) + the language gate over every tracked file
npm test               # Vitest: package tests and the repository tests in tests/repo/
npm run build          # tsc builds of every workspace package, in dependency order
```

- `lefthook.yml`: `pre-commit` runs typecheck, ESLint on staged files and the language gate in
  parallel (a Markdown-only commit skips typecheck and lint); `commit-msg` runs the language gate
  on the message; `pre-push` runs `npm run test:changed` (the tests related to the branch's changes and
  the repository tests; the full suite when a manifest, lockfile, migration, test setup or tool config changed).
- Never `--no-verify`. A red hook is a red gate: fix the cause.
- `npm test` must pass on macOS with its own tools, since its tests run in the pre-push hook there too. The shell scripts the
  tests run (the deploy workflow's steps, `deploy.sh`, the deploy e2e scripts) stay within bash 3.2 and flags that
  both BSD and GNU tools accept: no associative arrays, no `${var,,}`, no GNU-only long options. The `macos.yml`
  workflow runs those tests with the system tools first in `PATH` whenever the scripts, the workflows or their
  tests change, and once a week.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same gates (static, the full test suite in four shards, build) on every pull request, every push to
  master and on demand; `e2e.yml` the same, skipping documents-only changes. Their slow area jobs (the
  marketing-kit films, the host playbooks, the example app and deploy init image) run only when the change reaches
  that area through `scripts/ci/affected.mjs`; a shared root file runs them all. Not on every pushed branch:
  with a pull request open, that would run each suite twice.
- The repository tests guard the docs too: the roadmap contract (WORKFLOW §5), relative links in
  every `*.md`, and the shape of every workspace package. Start a package by copying
  `templates/package/`.
- Tests run with `NODE_ENV=test` and `TZ=America/New_York` whatever the shell exports
  (`vitest.config.mts`).

## Production deploys

The owner has given standing approval for production deploys (2026-10-14). A deploy runs right after the release
that carries it, without asking or waiting for the owner's word. This overrides the managed block below wherever it
says a production deploy waits for the owner.

## Merging: master only on a conflict

The owner's order (2026-11-04): a pull request is merged as it is, on the checks that were green at READY, unless
the forge reports a conflict with master (not mergeable). Only then is master merged into the branch, the conflict
resolved and the gates re-run. An incoming migration, dependency change or a file the branch also changes is no
reason on its own; `wt-merge-check.py` may print `remerge` for those, and this rule wins. The coordinator's go
never asks for an "Update branch". Master has no branch protection that requires an up-to-date branch. This
overrides "Merge the main branch in only when needed" in the managed block below.

# SOFTURE workflow and conventions

Installed by `@softure-ai/skills`. Project-specific rules outside this block take precedence,
except the language rule below (when this block carries it), which always applies.

## Language: English in the repository, `chatLanguage` in the chat (mandatory)

Two languages, kept apart in every project, manual and autonomous alike:

- **Everything written to the repository is English:** code, identifiers, comments, docstrings, tests
  and test names, commit messages, branch names, pull request titles and bodies, issue texts, script,
  log and error output, file and folder names, configuration keys, README and docs, `AGENTS.md` and
  skill instructions. This holds whatever language the owner writes in.
- **Everything said to the owner is in `chatLanguage`** from `context/workflow.json` (default:
  `language`): chat replies, questions, thread results, reports. English code is no reason to answer
  the owner in English, and a request in another language still produces English code.
- **Two narrow exceptions:** user-facing product copy lives in message dictionaries (e.g.
  `messages/pl.ts`), never inline in code; the prose of workflow artifacts under `context/` follows
  `language` (their headings stay English).
- When you touch a file with non-English code, comments or identifiers, translate them in the same
  change. Translating a whole codebase is a change of its own, never a side effect.
- Before every commit, scan the diff for non-English text outside message dictionaries and
  `context/` artifacts. Any hit is a failing gate, just like a red test.

## How work flows

Work happens as a chain of skills. Each one leaves a file in `context/` that the next one reads.
The full contract is in `node_modules/@softure-ai/skills/WORKFLOW.md`.

- **Product:** `softure-init` → `softure-shape` → `softure-prd` → `softure-roadmap`. Use
  `softure-frame` whenever the problem itself is in doubt.
- **One change:** `softure-new` → `softure-research` → `softure-plan` → `softure-plan-review` →
  `softure-implement` → `softure-impl-review` → `softure-archive`.
- **In parallel:** `softure-worktree` runs one change end to end in its own worktree.
  `softure-worktree-manager` runs several at once and merges them.
- **Any time:** `softure-code-review`, `softure-rule-review`, `softure-lesson`.

**Every change goes through the chain, however small.** A one-line fix reported in chat is a change
too (`roadmap_item: null`). `new`, `plan`, `plan-review`, `implement`, `impl-review` and `archive` are
never skipped. `research` and `frame` may be skipped only with a one-line reason under `## Notes` in
`change.md`. `research.md`, `plan.md` and `reviews/plan-review.md` exist before the first edit of
source code. Only the owner can waive this, for one named change, and only in manual mode.

**The project's operating mode** is `mode` in `context/workflow.json`: `manual` (also when the key is
missing) or `autonomous`. Its rules are the `## Operating mode` section below; it is the only mode
section in this block. Switch modes only on the owner's explicit word: set `mode`, re-run the installer
(`npx softure-skills`) so this block follows, commit both as `docs(rules): switch to <mode> mode`.

Execution state lives only in the `## Progress` section of `plan.md`. Commands, the main branch
and the artifact language come from `context/workflow.json`. Before building anything generic
(auth, mail, feature switches, billing, GDPR, analytics, UI primitives), check the
`@softure-ai/*` modules.

## Operating mode: autonomous

The owner sets the goal and is away. **`mode: "autonomous"` in the committed project config is the
owner's standing consent** for everything below: deciding every question the chain asks (`--auto` is
implied for every skill), committing, pushing session branches, opening and merging pull requests,
resolving conflicts, closing the issues the work solves, filing issues, starting and resolving
sessions (threads), giving threads their go, and running report routines. It lives in the repository,
so every session reads it here itself; it is not consent relayed by another session. A brief points
to this section instead of quoting chat messages. **Only a production deploy or release waits for the
owner's word** (see Releases). Nothing in this section needs to be told to a fresh session again;
a hosted project's coordinator that does not run inside a checkout gets one pointer to it in the
project instructions (WORKFLOW §8.5). A thread whose project instructions lack that pointer tells the
coordinator in its first message, with the snippet filled in; the coordinator then reads this block
and `context/workflow.json` from the main branch at once and follows them for the rest of the run,
without waiting for the paste (WORKFLOW §8.5, Bootstrap).

**Decide, don't ask.** Take the recommended option and record it under `## Decisions (auto)` in the
artifact. Small product decisions are yours: the owner trusts the recommendation and corrects it
later. Prefer the simplest solution that meets the intent. No decision cards, no "shall I…?", no
"waiting for the owner" for anything this section covers. Escalate only for: a destructive or
irreversible action nobody asked for, a secret or access only the owner has, scope that contradicts
`change.md`, a measurement that refutes the item's premise, or an idea for a new product or package
(tell the owner in the project chat to plan it together; file nothing).

**Know your role.** Work in parallel has one coordinator and its threads:
- **Coordinator**: the session in the project's main chat (the channel the owner talks to), or
  `softure-worktree-manager` locally. It plans, briefs, starts threads, gives the go to merge, and is
  the only one that talks to the owner.
- **Thread**: a session started by the coordinator with a brief (an item ID, a change-id, "follow
  AGENTS.md → Operating mode: autonomous"). It carries one change and talks only to the coordinator.
- A session started by the owner directly, with no coordinator, does both jobs itself.

**Start of a run.** A coordinator that wakes with no run in flight (a fresh or cleared session, or a
hosted project's main-chat session on its first message) starts the run itself, without waiting for
the owner's "go":
1. read `context/workflow.json` and the roadmap (or the issue queue) on the main branch; outside a
   checkout, read them, and this block, from the repository first. Then read the project's memory and
   its own coordinator conventions (the project's `AGENTS.md` outside this block). When memory lacks
   the run state (the serial merge queue holder, the report routine id, the lanes, which forge events
   do not reach the threads), write it there before starting threads;
2. adopt what is already in flight: roadmap rows `in_progress` or `ready_to_merge`, the harness's open
   threads, open pull requests (`softure-worktree-manager` M0.1); give the go to every READY thread;
3. start a thread for every startable item (below), items with no prerequisites included, whatever
   lane they sit in;
4. create the report routine and post the first roadmap report.
Only a "stop" or "pause" from the owner, recorded in memory, holds it back.

**Messages to the owner and between sessions:**
- In `chatLanguage` (default: `language`), whatever language the artifacts use.
- **Condensed: the decision first, then what was done.** First line: `Decision: <what the owner has to
  decide, with your recommendation>` when there is one; then two to five lines of outcome with
  evidence (PR, merge SHA, version, run link). No narrative of the steps.
- **The content goes in the message itself.** No artifacts, report files or documents created just to
  be linked; tables go into the message as markdown.
- **Everything ends up in the main chat.** A thread never reports by replying in its own thread: it
  sends its result to the coordinator's session (`send_message` or the harness's equivalent), and the
  coordinator posts it in the project's main chat. This holds for finished work, a blocker, a
  decision, and every roadmap report.

**Coordinator duties:**
- Writes no code: every fix, even one line, becomes a change in its own thread.
- One thread = one change (one issue). Very similar tiny items may share a thread; items that touch
  the same files go to the same thread or wait. A planning thread hands its result over and is closed.
  Before starting a thread, check that the item has none yet.
- **A new roadmap is two steps, never one thread.** When the owner hands over a new roadmap (or a
  revision), brief one roadmap thread that only shapes, records, commits and merges `roadmap.md`,
  then ends. Once it is merged, start one thread per ready item, as for any run. Never brief a single
  thread to record a roadmap and implement its items, or to implement a whole roadmap.
- Runs as many threads as are parallel-safe; `worktree.maxParallel` is a soft default.
- **The roadmap keeps rolling: recompute the startable set on every merge result and every report.**
  Read `roadmap.md` on `origin/<main>`; every item that is not done, has no thread, and whose
  prerequisites are all `done` or `done_code` on `<main>` (or has none) gets a thread now, within the
  parallel-safe limit. Never derive it only from the thread that just merged or from its lane
  successor: an item with no prerequisites is never "unblocked by a merge", and an item a sloppy
  merge round missed must still be picked up. `softure-worktree/scripts/wt-startable.py` prints the
  set (`START` rows; `WAIT` rows name the missing prerequisites). Never wait for the rest of the wave.
  Take no new items beyond the roadmap or the issue queue without the owner.
- A brief names the item ID and change-id, the outcome, the base branch, the files it owns, what it
  waits for, the merge path, how to report back (condensed, to the coordinator's session), and "follow
  AGENTS.md → Operating mode: autonomous". Project-specific standing orders are appended.
- **Gives the go itself.** A thread with a green pull request, no conflicts, inside the approved scope
  gets "go" from the coordinator right away (`message_thread` or the equivalent), never after asking
  the owner. **Check every thread waiting for your go on every report and every wake-up**: give the go
  or say what blocks it. A green PR that sits unmerged because nobody said "go" is the coordinator's
  failure.
- **Stale go:** a thread that got its go and has sent no merge SHA within 30 minutes is nudged at once
  (what is it waiting for, CI or a conflict?), not at the next report.
- Posts every thread's result in the main chat as it arrives (condensed, decision first).
- **Makes sure finished threads are closed.** On every merge result, and whenever a thread with a
  one-off job hands its result over (a planning thread, the report routine setup thread once it sends
  the routine id back, a report thread), check that the thread is resolved and resolve it yourself
  (`set_thread_resolved` or the equivalent) if it is not. Never close a thread whose pull request is
  still open.
- Nudges stalled threads (waiting on CI, stopped by a usage limit) on every report: every working
  thread silent for 45 minutes or more gets a nudge in that firing.
- A new question about the roadmap goes to a new thread; the old one is closed.

**Thread duties:**
- Run the whole chain for its change (`softure-worktree`), deciding by the rules above.
- **Check the coordinator's bootstrap** in a hosted project: at session start, look for the WORKFLOW
  §8.5 pointer (or any reference to this repository's `AGENTS.md`) in the project instructions the
  session was given. When it is missing, the first message to the coordinator says so, carries the
  snippet with `<owner>/<repo>` filled in, and asks the coordinator to tell the owner where to paste
  it. Then carry on with the change.
- At READY (green PR, the main branch merged in when Merging below says it is needed): send the
  condensed result to the coordinator and wait for its go. Never write that it waits for the owner.
  Without a coordinator, merge at READY.
- After the go: merge (below), then record the roadmap state on the main branch
  (`wt-roadmap.py done <change-id>`) and send the merge result to the coordinator.
- **Watch your own CI when PR events cannot reach you.** At session start, check whether pull request
  activity can reach the thread (the subscription succeeds, the forge app has access to the
  repository). If not, after every push check the pull request's checks yourself until they finish:
  a scheduled wake-up every few minutes, for at most about 60 minutes, then report what is still
  pending. Never end the turn waiting for an event that cannot arrive.
- **Close the thread only when the work is really done: its pull request is merged into the main
  branch** (`set_thread_resolved` or the equivalent). A thread with an open pull request stays open,
  READY included. It stays open also while an owner action gates its result.

**Merging.**
- Merges are serial, first ready first merged. A ready merge never waits for the owner.
- **The roadmap state lives on the main branch, never on a change branch.** Branches do not edit
  `roadmap.md`: `wt-roadmap.py` writes every stage on the main branch (`open`, `stage`, `ready`), and
  the thread runs `wt-roadmap.py done <change-id>` right after its merge; it takes the `## Done`,
  owner-check and release lines from the archived `change.md` (`softure-archive --handoff`). Only
  `worktree.cloudState: "branch"` keeps the old flow, where the branch carries its own row.
- **Merge the main branch in only when needed** (`autonomy.remergeMain: "when-needed"`, the default).
  After the go, run `softure-worktree/scripts/wt-merge-check.py`. `merge-as-is` (the forge reports the
  pull request mergeable, and since the branch last merged it the main branch brought no migration, no
  dependency change and no file the branch also changes): merge the pull request as it is; its checks
  were green at READY. `remerge`: merge the fresh main branch in, resolve conflicts yourself, run the
  `RUN` lines it prints, push. The main branch is the source of truth: what it has and the branch lacks
  is pulled in and wired. `"always"`: merge the main branch in before every merge.
- **A merge of the main branch re-runs only what it can break:** every gate except the test gate, plus
  `autonomy.relatedTests` for the files the branch changes. The full suite runs again only when the
  incoming changes add a migration or touch dependencies, test setup or config (`wt-merge-check.py`
  prints `GATES full`), and once per roadmap in the release gate.
- **Merge on green without polling.** When a merge has to wait for checks, enable the forge's auto-merge
  for the pull request at go time where it is available; poll the checks only where it is not.
- `autonomy.merge: "pr"` (default): open a pull request (`Closes #N` when it solves an issue), wait for
  green checks, merge it on the forge; the forge deletes the head branch. `"push"`: `git merge --no-ff`
  locally, then push the main branch through the pre-push hook.
- When one thread has had to chase the main branch several times, the coordinator tells the others
  to hold their merges until it lands.
- Hooks stay on: never `--no-verify`, never force-push, never disable or loosen a test to get green.
  Long hooks run in the background with the longest timeout; a hung one is killed by its PID and
  re-run.
- The main branch is already tested: do not re-run gates on it to review it. The full integration
  suite runs per `integration.cadence`, never per push.

**Roadmap reports** (coordinator, pasted into the main chat, times in `timezone`):
- When: after every batch of thread starts (an ad-hoc post), and every `autonomy.reports.every`
  minutes (default 60) on full hours inside `autonomy.reports.hours`, only while work runs.
  `hours: null` (the default) means around the clock, and that is the recommended setting for an
  autonomous run: the report routine is also the run's heartbeat (it recomputes the startable set,
  gives the go, nudges stalled threads), so a window that sleeps at night leaves the night
  unsupervised. Routines
  fire at most once an hour, on the full hour, so the schedule is `every` rounded up to a multiple of
  60 (60 → `0 * * * *`, 120 → `0 */2 * * *`; `wt_config.py --report-cron` prints it); a value below 60
  runs hourly. **One recurring routine** drives the reports: the coordinator creates it when work
  starts and deletes it when nothing runs, or on the owner's "stop" or "pause". Never a chain of
  one-off wake-ups. **A coordinator without a scheduling tool** (a hosted project's main-chat session)
  starts one short setup thread whose only job is to create that routine from the template
  `softure-worktree-manager/references/report-routine.md` and send its id back; the setup thread is
  then closed. The coordinator records the id in memory and, at the end of the run or on "stop" or
  "pause", has a thread delete the routine by that id. Missing tools never mean skipped reports. After a pause (usage limit) name the reports that were skipped. A report produced in a thread of its own (a scheduled routine) is pasted into the main
  chat and that thread is closed at once.
- Shape, the same in every project, nothing else:
  1. title: `Roadmap report <roadmap name>, <HH:MM>`;
  2. one sentence on what is done, with the **current** counter `X of N on <main>`. N is the number of
     roadmap items; X rises with every merged roadmap item. Work outside the roadmap and a merge that
     only sets an item to blocked do not count;
  3. one table with **only the items not done yet**, always these four columns in this order:
     - **ID**: the roadmap item ID, an uppercase prefix of two or three letters plus a number (`FC-5`,
       `SA-12`, `CMP-3`); in issue mode the issue number (`#42`). Bold, nothing else in the cell.
     - **What it does**: the outcome in a few words.
     - **Stage**: `waiting for <IDs>` (the prerequisite IDs not yet on `<main>`; `waiting for
       predecessors` without IDs is invalid), `research`, `frame`, `plan`, `plan-review`, `implement N/M`,
       `impl-review`, `integration`, `archive`, `ready to merge (PR #N)`, `merging (PR #N)`,
       `blocked (<why>)`, `waits for the owner (<what>)`; add `stalled` when the thread has not moved
       since the last report. An item whose prerequisites are all on `<main>` but has no thread is a
       coordinator failure: start its thread in the same firing, before posting the report.
     - **Link**: a markdown link to the thread that carries the item, `[thread](<url>)`; `—` when it has
       none. Never a forge URL: the PR number lives in Stage;
  4. `Decision: …` when the owner has something to decide;
  5. one line with the times: next merge in line, deadlines that matter, next report.
- Headers and prose in `chatLanguage` (a Polish owner gets the header row `ID | Co robi | Etap | Link`).
  Example, shown in English (roadmap prefix `SA`):

  ```markdown
  **Roadmap report softure-auth, 14:00**
  Done: 47 of 50 on master (latest SA-31, SA-59).

  | ID | What it does | Stage | Link |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | **SA-33** | Registration behind a feature switch | blocked (SOFTURE/AI#301) | [thread](https://claude.ai/code/session_01AbC) |
  | **SA-35** | Password reset by email | implement 2/3 | [thread](https://claude.ai/code/session_01DeF) |
  | **SA-7** | Integration and release | waits for the owner (release) | — |

  Decision: SA-7 can be released after SA-35; waiting for your word.
  Times: SA-35 ready to merge around 15:30; next report 15:00.
  ```

  Nothing moved since the last report: one line (`15:00, no change: 47 of 50; SA-35 implement 2/3`).

**Bugs and gaps in SOFTURE packages.** A well-founded, non-duplicate bug or gap is filed right away as
an issue, without asking, in the repository that owns it:
- `@softure-ai/skills` (the skills, this managed block, `WORKFLOW.md`) → **SOFTURE/SKILLS**;
- every other `@softure-ai/*` package → **SOFTURE/AI**;
- this project's own scope → this project's repository.

Search the target for a duplicate first. When the harness scopes forge access to this project, attach
the owning repository first (read and issues) and only then decide you cannot file; if it is still out
of reach, put the issue text in the main chat for the owner. The work goes on around it; the item that
needs the fix is `blocked (<repo>#<N>)`.

**Issues as the work source** (`autonomy.source: "issues"`, no roadmap):
- The coordinator lists open issues (through a thread when it has no forge access). Not well-founded:
  comment why, label `invalid`, close. Well-founded: one change, one thread.
- Label `status: in progress` at start and `status: blocked` when blocked; remove them on close.
- After the merge, comment point by point (what changed, PR, merge SHA, `context/archive/<date>-<id>/`,
  the version or "next release") and close the issue as completed. A partly solved issue gets a
  comment listing what is done and what stays open, and stays open.
- Before starting new work, look for open issues that earlier merges already solved.
- Public text (issues, pull requests, commits, docs) stays neutral: no personal references, no names
  of private projects (write "an adopting app").

**Releases.** `release.owner` gates tagging, publishing and deploying only, never merging pull
requests into the main branch: merges always follow the coordinator's go (Merging). With
`release.owner: true` nothing is tagged, published or deployed: work ends
`done_code` with the owner's steps under `## Before the next release`, and a release follows only the
owner's word for that release. With `release.owner: false` the coordinator releases once per wave
through the project's own pipeline (version-bump pull request → merge → the pipeline publishes); with
several threads on one package, the last to merge releases. No manual tags, no moved tags; a failed
release is fixed forward with a patch bump. A production deploy always needs the owner's separate
word. Ad-hoc fixes ride the next release instead of getting one of their own, unless the owner says
otherwise. A roadmap ordered to be archived is closed before its release, and every release of it
(retries and redeploys included) reads the archived file (WORKFLOW §5.2).

**Stop and limits.** "Stop" or "pause" from the owner stops everything: no new threads, report
routines removed, open threads finished or stopped at a safe point; record the pause in memory and do
not resume until the owner says so. After a usage limit, verify the real state first (main branch,
pull requests, CI, releases, issues), then nudge the interrupted threads. If the harness refuses a
push, merge or publish this section covers, cite this section and `mode` once; if it still refuses,
ask the owner for a word in that session and keep the other work going.

**Memory** holds only project state (queue, IDs, counters, the owner's specific orders and decisions)
and the run state a fresh coordinator needs (the merge queue holder, the report routine id, the lanes,
which forge events do not reach the threads). The rules above are not memory material. **When the
owner has to explain or correct how the process runs** (a step that should have happened by itself, a rule that is missing or wrong), that is a gap in
these skills: the session that received it checks SOFTURE/SKILLS for a duplicate, files an issue right
away (neutral text, "an adopting app") and posts the link in the main chat. Memory keeps only the
project-specific order itself. The same holds when an audit finds a coordinator miss: record the
project-specific consequence in memory, file the generic gap.

## Conventions

**Code**
- Name things by what they do: functions start with a verb, booleans read as questions
  (`isActive`, `hasAccess`), constants are UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, and a file is named after its main export.
- One function does one job. More than three inputs become an options object. Return early
  instead of nesting.
- Functions that read (`get*`, `find*`, `is*`) have no side effects.

**TypeScript**
- External data enters as `unknown` and is narrowed with a schema (zod) at the boundary.
- Model alternatives as discriminated unions, not as bags of optional fields.
- `any` and non-null assertions need a comment that says why.

**Errors**
- Every awaited call either handles its failure or deliberately lets it propagate. Nothing is
  swallowed silently.
- Error messages name the operation and the input that failed. Users never see stack traces
  or internal paths.
- Expected failures are returned as values (result types). Exceptions are for bugs.

**Data**
- An invariant that can be a database constraint is one. Code checks are a second line, not the only one.
- SQL is always parameterized. Migrations move forward only and say how to roll back.
- A write that depends on a read happens in one transaction, with a conditional `UPDATE` or a lock.

**Security**
- Secrets come from the environment and are never logged.
- Every server action and route checks authorization, not just a session.
- Public endpoints are rate-limited and validate their input.

**React / Next.js**
- Server components by default. Use client components only for interaction.
- User-visible text, including `aria-label`, goes through the project's message layer.
- Styling uses design tokens. Raw colours and magic sizes are not allowed.

**Tests**
- A test name states the behaviour. Each test builds and cleans up its own data.
- Assert exact values. Cover empty, boundary and failure cases.
- A bug fix starts with a test that fails without it.
